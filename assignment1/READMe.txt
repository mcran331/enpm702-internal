This code controls a virtual robot that is capable of both translation and rotation. The user follows the prompts and chooses which movement to execute.

This code assumes that the default location/orientation of the robot is at the origin (0,0) and pointed to the right (0 degrees, positive x direction).

The robot can be at any (x,y) position, but the orientation will always be reported as a value between 0 and 360 degrees.

There may be some secret movements that are not listed on the menu, feel free to explore and try different inputs.

But do be mindful of the error monster... They will come get you if your inputs are invalid.
